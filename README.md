# Hi there 👋

I'm Nicola, an ML engineer from Italy. 🇮🇹

As I prefer working from the terminal, [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) make a central part of my workflow.
Working in ML has led me to specialize in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## My Projects 📦

These are projects and tools that I develop in my free time.

- [**Breadcrumbs**](https://github.com/niqodea/breadcrumbs): My take on using symlinks effectively to handle upward navigation. 🍞
- [**Meerkat**](https://github.com/niqodea/meerkat): A library for monitoring data sources and tracking changes over time. 🐿️
- [**tmux-matryoshka**](https://github.com/niqodea/tmux-matryoshka): A tmux plugin for nested tmux workflows that supports arbitrary levels of nesting. 🪆
- [**hburger**](https://github.com/niqodea/hburger): A command to compress strings and path in a readable way and tame the length of CWD in your shell prompt. 🍔
- [**lasso.nvim**](https://github.com/niqodea/lasso.nvim): A Neovim plugin to mark files for easy access, lightweight alternative to [harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon). 🤠
- [**Ropify**](https://github.com/niqodea/ropify): A simple [Rope](https://github.com/python-rope/rope) CLI wrapper and Neovim bindings that provide Python refactoring capabilities in the editor. 🪢
- [**Python Monorepo**](https://github.com/niqodea/python-monorepo): A scalable template for a generic Python monorepo. 🐍
- [**PyTorch Mediator**](https://github.com/niqodea/pytorch-mediator): A template for wrapping ML research code with user-friendly APIs. 🎁
- [**AI Avatar**](https://github.com/niqodea/ai-avatar): A simple client-server CLI application to generate AI avatars using diffusion models. 🖼

### Personal Projects 🏠

These projects are more personal in nature, but also documented for others to use.

- [**Dev Environment**](https://github.com/niqodea/dev-environment): I keep track of my dotfiles and installations to keep things consistenct across machines. 🛠️
- [**Corne keyboard**](https://github.com/niqodea/crkbd): My Corne keyboard layout, with a README explaining the design choices behind it. ⌨️
- [**Home Infrastructure**](https://github.com/niqodea/home-infrastructure): I selfhost a few applications with Docker, managed using `docker compose`. 🐳
