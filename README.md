# Hi there 👋

I'm Nicola, an AI engineer from Italy. 🇮🇹

This is where I share projects and tools that I've crafted in my free time.

## My Dev Environment 🛠️

- [**Neovim**](https://github.com/neovim/neovim): I use nvim to write code and have built my own configuration. 📝
- [**Dotfiles**](https://github.com/niqodea/dotfiles): I keep track of my dotfiles to keep things consistent across machines. 💾

## Personal Projects 📦

- [**Home Infrastructure**](https://github.com/niqodea/home-infrastructure): I selfhost a few applications with Docker, managed using `docker-compose`. 🐳
- [**Breadcrumbs**](https://github.com/niqodea/breadcrumbs): My take on using symlinks effectively. 🍞
- [**Git Doppelganger**](https://github.com/niqodea/doppelganger): A tool combining aspects of Git's `merge` and `rebase`. 👯‍♀️
